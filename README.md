## [Projects](projects.md)
### [theGuys.design](https://theguys.design)
  > React, Next
  
  I saw a lot of React Component libraries but none of them met my expectations and that's why I decided to do one by myself. I spend a lot of time on this project and I still can see how much is to do.
### [collo](https://collo.theguys.app)
  > Node
  
  Born as a token generator (which tooks your password, encrypt it and save it in `config` folder) and then rewritten to something look-a-like [deem](#Projects--deem) below.
### [deem](https://deem.theguys.app) _unfinished_
  > React, Next
  
  deem was firstly written as pure JavaScript editor for text testing—how paragraphs or headers looks with different variants of font weights, sizes or colors. I've rewrite it into React app which became my sandbox at the end.
### Witcher quotes
  > Node, MongoDB, JavaScript, Next
  
  First adventure with MongoDB.
### dotfiles
  > shell, Node

## [Open-Source](open.md)
> Projects with my contributions.

As Open-Source has stole my heart I spend a lot of time with Open-Source code on GitHub or GitLab. This is, in my opinion, true magic of programming. That is the reason I am sure that I found my place on Earth :heart: (yep, sic! I know :wink:)
