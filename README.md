## Projects

### [theGuys.design](https://theguys.design)

> React, Next
  
  I saw a lot of React Component libraries but none of them met my expectations and that's why I decided to do one by myself. I spend a lot of time on this project and I still can see how much is to do.
  
  Source code is [here](https://github.com/robertgrzonka/theguys) on GitHub.
  
### [collo](https://collo.theguys.app)

> Node
  
  Born as a token generator (which tooks your password, encrypt it and save it in `config` folder) and then rewritten to something look-a-like [deem](#Projects--deem) below.
  
  Source code is [here](https://github.com/robertgrzonka/collo) on GitHub.

### [deem](https://deem.theguys.app) 
_undone_

> React, Next
  
deem was firstly written as pure JavaScript editor for text testing‚Äîhow paragraphs or headers looks with different variants of font weights, sizes or colors. I've rewrite it into React app which became my sandbox at the end.
  
Source code is [here](https://github.com/robertgrzonka/deem) on GitHub.
  
### [Witcher quotes](https://wiedzmin.now.sh)

> Node, MongoDB, JavaScript, Next
  
First adventure with MongoDB.
  
Source code is [here](https://gitlab.com/robertgrzonka/witcher-quotes) on GitLab.
  
### [dotfiles](https://github.com/robertgrzonka/dotfiles)

> shell, Node

## Open-Source

> Projects with my contributions.

As Open-Source philosophy has stole my heart I spend a lot of time with Open-Source code on GitHub or GitLab. This is, in my opinion, true magic of programming. That is the reason I am sure that I found my place on Earth :heart: (yep, sic! I know :wink:)

I am also [Patreon](https://patreon.com) of [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) as he is my personal open-source hero :)

## Passions

* Typography ‚Äî I've learned a lot from [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com).
* Pandoc ‚Äî together with LaTeX are my life-changer tools. I fall in love with them as much as in programming.
* LaTeX ‚Äî as above.
* World of Tanks Blitz :video_game: yep, I am true WoT player who plays **every-single-day**. But no worries: I am programming every-single-day as well ;)
